use HTML helper using @ and attribute using [] , attribute is similar like annotation

Controllers=> action method treated as URL or routing we can access method on browser using method name in url like localhost:8080/controllername/methodname 
it will execute that method code on browser.
mother of all result type is ActionResult; // if method type is this we can return any datatype.
to redirect between Pages return that function.
just write [HttpGet] before method this will make that function as post method,
[HttpPost].
@* comment *@

asp_action="path of view" // for navigating, use this in html code
extension for view .cshtml

viewdata = transfer data to controller.// ViewBag also same only syntax different
similar TempData
ViewData["a"] = variable; // to store value of variable and show it on browser
to access this in html we have to use @ symbol before this
 => <h1>@ViewData["a"]</h1>
=> <input type="text" value="@ViewBag.a" />
=><h1> Value of a = @TempData["a"]  </h1>
Ragor code = writing c sharp inside html ;
