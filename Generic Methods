Generic Collections
List: Represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index.
Dictionary<TKey, TValue>: Represents a collection of key/value pairs.
HashSet: Represents a set of values.
Queue: Represents a first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection of objects.
Stack: Represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection of objects.
LinkedList: Represents a doubly linked list.
SortedList<TKey, TValue>: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys.
SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys.
SortedSet: Represents a collection of objects that is maintained in sorted order.
ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>: Represents a thread-safe collection of key/value pairs.

Non-Generic Collections
ArrayList: Represents an ordered collection of objects.
Hashtable: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.
Queue: Represents a first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection of objects.
Stack: Represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection of objects.
SortedList: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys.
BitArray: Manages a compact array of bit values, which are represented as Booleans.
HybridDictionary: A collection that starts as a ListDictionary and switches to a Hashtable when the collection gets large.
ListDictionary: Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are accessible by the key or index.


Capacity	
Gets the total numbers of elements the internal data structure can hold without resizing.

Count	
Gets the number of elements contained in the Stack<T>.

Contains(T)	
Determines whether an element is in the Stack<T>.
GetHashCode()	
Serves as the default hash function. Inherited from Object
GetType()	
Gets the Type of the current instance. Inherited from Object
MemberwiseClone()	
Creates a shallow copy of the current Object. Inherited from Object
